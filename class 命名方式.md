## What If You Don’t Know the Function/Purpose Yet?

If you only have a vague idea about what a class is going to be doing when you start to work on it and have a hard time coming up with any name, just call it something ridiculous to remind yourself later that the name needs to be changed. And by ridiculous I don’t mean some vague name like `Manager` or `Handler`; just call it `Dolphin` or `Penguin` or `Fairy` or whatever weird and unrelated name that comes into your mind. It should be strange enough for you to not be tempted to keep it. Later on, when that class is written, it will be easier to give it a proper name.
